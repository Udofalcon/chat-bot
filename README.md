# chat-bot
An amalgamation of bots working together. 
This is a public version of my UdofalconBot scripts and a sort of tutorial for those looking to make their own.
My plan is to run this on a Raspberry Pi or and Alpine docker container.

This will have:
* An admin dashboard/ui to use as a stream deck
* Twitch integration
* Discord integration
* Twitter integration
